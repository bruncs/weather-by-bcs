```bash
npm install
```
```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

Run the script below, using npm or yarn, to start the development server:

```bash

yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Prerequisite

- You need to be connected to the internet.

## Technologies Used

Despite the code assignment demanded a simple application, with much less libraries, I choose to exemplify how would be the code base for a scalable frontend application. I know that, for real life applications, this is considered over-engineering. But in order to show how to setup a Redux store properly, with data normalization, error handling, and so on, I used the technologies below. I listed under each techonlogy the advantages that I considered important when picking it.

### TypeScript
- Static typing
- Code scalability
- ECMAScript compliance

### React Google Maps API
- Good documentation
- Easy integration
- Easy customization

### Next.js
- Automatic compilation, bundling and
- Code splitting
- TypeScript support
- Built-in CSS support
- Fast refresh at development environment

### Redux
- Predictable state updates
- Centralized state
- Easier to test

### Redux Saga
- Popularity
- Open source community support

### Normalizr
- Makes frontend able to handle different shapes of API responses
- Recommended by Redux documentation

### Axios
- Supports older browsers
- Enables request and response interceptors

## Additional Info
It was intented to strictly attend the functional requirements listed on the code assignment description. Not including additional features or undemanded requirements.
